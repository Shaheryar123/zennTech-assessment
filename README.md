# ZennTech Fullstack Developer Assessment

All four tasks are organized in their respective folders, each containing a README.md file with the relevant guidelines.

For the written tasks, I chose to provide my responses in HTML format instead of plain text or Markdown for better structure and presentation.

Additionally, Iâ€™ve included a bonus section related to the real estate domain, as I noticed your company has raised funds for a real estate product. I proposed this bonus task to demonstrate my ability to contribute to product advancement and enhancement.
